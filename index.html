        <h2>Meaven4</h2>
        <img src="Screenshot 2024-12-01 204016.png" alt="" class="project-image">
        <p>For our final exam, my team and I developed Meaven (Media Heaven), a
            CRUD-based website inspired by MyAnimeList, IMDb, and Letterboxd. The
            website allows users to browse movies, which can be added to their personal
            watchlist by clicking the "Add Film" button. The website is powered by MySQL
            for the database and uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end and
            back-end development. We integrated IMDb's API to dynamically fetch movie
            data, streamlining the process without needing manual data entry. This
            project was a significant collaborative effort, combining both front-end and
            back-end development to create a seamless user experience for media
            enthusiasts. Currently, the website only features the home page displaying
            movies, with plans to expand further to include TV shows and additional
            features in the future.</p>
